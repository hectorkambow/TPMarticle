## TPM what are they good for?

When it comes to Security in a New Age – it never hurts to learn some tried and true methods that have proven effective in terms of security.

### What is a TPM?
When it comes to Security in a New Age – it never hurts to learn some tried and true methods that have proven effective in terms of security. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is technology that was created by the Trusted Computer Group (TCG) in an effort to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. ([ISO](www.iso.org/standard/50970.html))
As stated by the (TCG) a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is "an implementation of a defined set of capabilities that is intended to provide authentication and attestation functionality for a computing device, and protect information by controlling access to plain-text data. ([ISO](www.iso.org/standard/50970.html))
It has become an international standard for secure micro-processors and was standardized by the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2009. ([ISO](www.iso.org/standard/50970.html))

### What is the benefit of using a TPM?

Implementing security precautions on a hardware level provides more protection than a software solution could on its own. If such precautions were taken in software only, the system may be more prone to certain types of attacks. ([TCPA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1088853))
The main principle benefit of using a TPM is to ensure the ‘integrity’ of a system or platform; by ‘integrity’ one could simply state to ensure the platform or system is running and operating as intended by the end user. ([INTEL](www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf))
Having a TPM utility allows users the secure ability to authenticate and identify personnel. 
It can be used to add an extra layer of encryption key storage and password protection to user devices. ([IBM](https://web.archive.org/web/20160803203400/http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=pos1R1003970&aid=1))

### Use Case Example?

One REAL world use case example of this type of technology being used today is by the United States government.
The Department of Defense (DoD) has stated since 2014 that new computer assets will include a TPM version 1.2 or higher and anticipates the technology to be used for device encryption, authentication, identification, and device integrity verification.([DOD](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/i8500_01.pdf))

Many other departments and organizations can be wise in implementing TPM solutions in their cyber security practices.

Security is an ongoing and raising concern, and learning more about the tools 
at hand and that exist is key in understanding how it can affect us.
